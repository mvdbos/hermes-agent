/**
 * Map (col, row) screen coordinates to a copy-source SelectionPoint.
 *
 * Used by the new transcript-virtual selection pipeline: when a mouse
 * event fires at (col, row), this walks the DOM to find the nearest
 * ancestor box tagged with `style.copyRangeId` and translates the
 * coords to (visualLine, col) relative to that box's rect.
 *
 * If the deepest hit ancestor also has `style.copySourceFragment` set
 * (the per-segment tag attached to each <Text> by markdown inline
 * rendering), the SelectionPoint includes a precomputed `sourceOffset`
 * — the EXACT byte offset within the enclosing range's outerSource.
 * Host code uses this directly without consulting `getOffset`, sidestepping
 * the width-math that would otherwise be needed for formatted segments
 * like `**bold**` or `$math$` where rendered cells ≠ source bytes.
 *
 * The returned SelectionPoint is structurally identical to the
 * `lib/copySource/types.ts` SelectionPoint (host code), but this module
 * doesn't import from there to avoid a circular dependency (host depends
 * on hermes-ink, not vice versa). Host code reinterprets the returned
 * object via a duck-typed cast.
 *
 * Gap handling: when (col,row) isn't inside any tagged region, we walk
 * the entire DOM looking for ranges and return the rangeIds of the
 * nearest ranges above (`beforeRangeId`) and below (`afterRangeId`).
 * This lets toCopyText anchor the gap-endpoint correctly between two
 * known messages instead of degrading to far-end-of-doc.

 *
 * `root` is the Ink rootNode. The walk uses nodeCache rects (computed
 * by the last frame's render pass), which already account for
 * scrollTop translation — so a click on a visually-on-screen row that
 * came from a virtually-scrolled ScrollBox is hit correctly.
 *
 * `endpoint` controls how the per-cell click maps to a source-byte
 * offset on verbatim fragments. Selection bounds are stored as
 * CELL-INCLUSIVE coords (anchor/focus both point AT the cell containing
 * the character), but `String.slice(from, to)` is `to`-EXCLUSIVE. So
 * for the END of a selection we must add 1 to skip past the clicked
 * cell; for the START we use the cell's start byte as-is.
 *
 *   - 'start' (default): start-of-clicked-cell.
 *     Used for the anchor of a selection, and for mouse-click probes
 *     where there's no anchor/focus context yet.
 *   - 'end': one past the clicked cell, clamped to the fragment end.
 *     Used for the focus of a finalized selection (where the cell is
 *     the LAST included cell, and slice(from, to) needs `to` past it).
 *
 * Non-verbatim fragments already use the half-cell heuristic (left
 * half → fragment start, right half → fragment end) which is
 * endpoint-agnostic; `endpoint` is ignored for them.
